# DJAmplifire


This is a web application that is designed to create online Rooms for multiple users to gather in and listen to music. It will provide features for users who will be a DJ and host the room and have administrative authority over their own session and features for users who will enter an existing room as a Guest. Music will be played using the Spotify API, connecting through the DJ’s spotify account and accessing the DJ’s playlists’. API calls will be reduced by persisting user data in a database (spotify account and playlist details).
